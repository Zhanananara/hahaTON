        <h2>History of the Chanel brand</h2>
        <p>
          Chanel is one of the most influential French fashion houses, founded
          by couturier Gabrielle "Coco" Chanel. The brand has established itself
          well both in the field of Pret-a-porter and in the field of Haute
          Couture, producing luxury goods: clothes, shoes, bags, perfumes,
          cosmetics, jewelry. For February, 2013 the Fashion house is a part of
          the Parisian Haute Couture Syndicate. The founder of the House got the
          nickname "Coco" while working as a cabaret singer in France. This
          pseudonym became her name in the fashion industry. Chanel's vision for
          women's style was to replace glamorous and sexy pieces with more
          casual and elegant pieces. So, the couturier brought into fashion
          simple straight dresses without corsets with a minimum of decor, as
          well as women's trouser suits. The most famous product of the designer
          and her Fashion House today is the little black dress (“little black
          dress”).

        <h2>Chanel No. 5: the creation of a legendary fragrance</h2>
        <p>
          In 1921, Coco Chanel introduced the first women's perfume - Chanel No.
          5 perfume. The history of the creation of this perfume is closely
          connected with the relationship between Coco and the Great Russian
          Prince Dmitry Pavlovich Romanov. Chanel and the prince met in Biarritz
          in 1920 and spent the next year together. It was then that Dmitry
          Pavlovich introduced his passion to the perfumer of the Romanov family
          - Ernest Bo, who, at the request of the milliner, helped her in
          creating her own perfume. As conceived by Coco, the fragrance was to
          embody the smell of a woman entirely. In addition, she wanted the
          composition to include more different essences, and not just one or
          two, as in the perfumes of those times. Ernest Bo has been working on
          perfumes for many months, mixing many components. At one of the
          meetings with Coco, he showed her several variants of the fragrances
          he created. Chanel chose the fifth bottle in a row, and, in addition,
          Chanel's favorite number was also 5. The designer decided to focus on
          this blend of essences and named her first Chanel No. 5 perfume. The
          fragrance composition consisted of 80 ingredients, including
          ylang-ylang from the Comoros, orange blossom, jasmine from the Grass
          fields, May rose, sandalwood, Bourbon vetiver and aldehydes –
          artificial components whose concentration in Chanel perfumes was a
          record for those years. According to legend, when creating the
          fragrance, Bo accidentally exceeded the dose of aldehydes in the
          fragrance, but that's why Chanel liked the smell so much. And the
          couturier was not mistaken in her choice, because the perfume became a
          hit. In addition, Chanel No. 5 is still an ageless classic, a standard
          of elegance and one of the most exquisite women's fragrances according
          to perfumers Chanel No. 5 toilet perfumes based on the original ones
          were created in 1986 by the perfumer of the Fashion House Jacques
          Polge.

        <h2>Influence on world fashion</h2>
        <p>
          Coco Chanel has revolutionized the fashion world by offering loose
          suits and long straight dresses to replace traditional corsets. The
          couturier has introduced many elements of men's classic fashion into
          women's clothing. Her simple lines led to the popularity of the boyish
          build of the female body, the rejection of glamour and excessive
          luxury in a suit. Coco Chanel clothes also gave women more comfort in
          everyday life, allowing them to make it more active. Coco made the
          jersey fabric fashionable, and her branded tweed suits became a symbol
          of the fashion of the 20s and an eternal classic in the women's
          wardrobe. Some of the iconic luxury items from Chanel are also quilted
          bags with long chains, square jackets and pearl necklaces.
